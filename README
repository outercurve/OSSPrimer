The project is generating an open source software primer for executives.  We seem to be seeing a second wave of interest, enthusiasm, and fear about free and open source software.  It's time to pull together a basic primer to get the next set of decision makers over the How & Why of it.  

This book source is _asciidoc_ and we're using the _asciidoc_ tool chain.   

Websites, tools, references, etc. can be found: 

* The http://asciidoc.org/ [_Official Ascii Doc site_]. This site contains references, cheat sheets, templates, and how-to documentation on installing and running the tool chain (asciiidoc.py, et al). 
* The http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc [AsciiDoc Cheatsheet].
* The http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html [AsciiDoc User Guide].
* The http://asciidoc.org/INSTALL.html [AsciiDoc Installation Process].
* I actually found this to be an enormously helpful Mac OS X site for installing asciidoc and its brethren: http://www.ladysign-apps.com/developer/environment/install-asciidoc-on-the-commandline-mac-osx/  [http://www.ladysign-apps.com/developer/environment/install-asciidoc-on-the-commandline-mac-osx/]
